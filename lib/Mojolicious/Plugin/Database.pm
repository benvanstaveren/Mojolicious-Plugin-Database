=head1 NAME

Mojolicious::Plugin::Database - "proper" handling of DBI based connections in Mojolicious

=head1 VERSION

Version 0.02

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Provides "sane" handling of DBI connections so problems with pre-forking (Hypnotoad, etc.) will not occur. 

    use Mojolicious::Plugin::Database;

    sub startup {
        my $self = shift;

        $self->plugin('database', { 
            dsn      => 'dbi:Pg:dbname=foo',
            username => 'myusername',
            password => 'mypassword',
            options  => { 'pg_enable_utf8' => 1, AutoCommit => 0 },
            helper   => 'db',
            });
    }

=head1 CONFIGURATION

The only required option is the 'dsn' one, which should contain a valid DBI dsn to connect to your database of choice. The actual connection is made when the plugin is registered. 

=head1 METHODS/HELPERS

A helper is created with a name you specified (or 'db' by default) that can be used to get the active DBI connection.
